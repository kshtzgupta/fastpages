My name is Kshitiz Gupta. I currently work as a Deep Learning Solutions Architect at NVIDIA solving problems in Conversational AI, Computer Vision, Tabular Data Science, and GPU Machine Learning in general. I studied Statistics and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, mostly focusing on Statistical Machine Learning.

I started Safari ML to share my excitement about Machine Learning. I am still learning myself, but I found that writing posts and tutorials is the best way to deepen my own understanding. Topics I am currently excited about are Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, so these will account for most of the posts on here.

I enjoy traveling and living in different places. So far I’ve lived in 4 countries (India, UAE, Saudi Arabia and US). I am happy to help in any way I can so don’t hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:kshtzgupta1997@gmail.com)
